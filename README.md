## Description
If there is a seating plan as a default, students see this as fair. 
If there is a seating plan, students don't only sit with their friends

## Problem

I have two main problems with seating plans. 
1. Keeping track of constraints (drama is dynamic with young people)
2. Quick rearrangement of seating plan for different purposes (e.g. peer tutoring pairs, small groups, friends together)
3. Different rooms have different layouts. If you have one class in a number of different classrooms, then a new seating plan will need to be created for each classroom
4. Sharing seating plan with other teachers

### Basic Workflow

## License
This is a free software project distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. You are welcome to reuse and modify the code in accordance with the provisions of this license.

## Feedback 
If you use this application, I would be interested in any feedback. 

## TODO
2. Generate multiple seating plans that user can navigate through
3. Undo functionality
4. Edit Class-name (add this stage you can just copy a class and rename it)
5. Clean up code

6. Improve on boarding flows
7. No selection state in the seating plan to show where a student would be placed when added.


8. Have the app on one page.
9. In the editor, make it so that apps can have columns added to the right and top. Not just the end.


## IMPROVE UX IDEAS
1. Include an instructional video
2. Some instructional text
3. Include some example rooms, classroom, and layout to help the user.
Think about how to get people to use the app, and provide feedback. Potentially,
