## Description
If there is a seating plan as a default, students see this as fair. 

We have seating plans, students don't just sit with their friends

## Problem

I have two main problems with seating plans. 
1. Keeping track of constraints (dramma is dynamic with young people)
2. Quick rearrangement of seating plan for different purposes (e.g. peer tutoring pairs, small groups, friends together)
3. Different rooms have different layouts. If you have one class in a number of different classrooms, then a new seating plan will need to be created for each classroom
4. Sharing seating plan with other teachers
